## Welcome to my bash final.

The main goal of this program was to get an A in my Linux class.  Secondary objective is to make a useful program foundation
for use in data management and research.  In its current rendition, it will parse a text file for a keyword, constantly until the program fails to find another iteration of said keyword, also ignoring line delimiters, and will append the row contents to a new text file.  I have not tried this with a file containing multiple lines including the keyword so there is much more to be done.. this is just the base  

## Possible Use Cases
â€¢analyzing server logs for suspect ip entries


Enter as many numbers from the IP that you can example, 192.168.12.3, this will
pull the entire line, for every instance that is related to that ip, and print/append the data
to a new file with the name of the search issued.  needs formatting work, but im busy now...
much apologies.
### Warning

By nature, I break things that work well.  Just how it goes for me. That being said, I can make no certain prediction on how this code will react with a file, though it has not resulted in the loss of data for me during testing, if you use this outside of the scope of testing in a production environment, I should not be held responsible for your neglect to heed my warning.. Have fun!
